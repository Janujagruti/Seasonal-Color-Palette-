# Seasonal-Color-Palette-
Developed a Seasonal Color Palette web app using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS to recommend suitable and avoidable colors based on user inputs like eye color, hair color, and skin tone.

Technologies Used:PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, XAMPP

Developed a web-based application to help users discover their ideal color palette based on their personal features. The app collects user input such as name, email, eye color, hair color, and skin tone through a form on index.php.

The core logic is handled in color_theory.php, which establishes a connection with the MySQL database, evaluates combinations of the user's features, and determines suitable and unsuitable colors based on seasonal color theory.

The result is displayed on result.php, providing users with personalized color recommendations to enhance their appearance.
